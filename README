lite-raft is still under early development stage.
this release is just to for preview and playing.

here the steps you need to do manually for now:
- configure conf/cluster_nodes with a space
separated list of hostname (those that will form
the cluster)

- verify that the user you use to test it is able
to execute ssh on between node without password
and without confirmation for ssh key fingerprint.

- copy the lite-raft directory on every node and 
execute it with ./lite-raft first-boot

to stop it on a node: ./lite-raft stop
to start (from second time and on): ./lite-raft start
to insert a test entry ./lite-raft-client set key value

read the code and give me feedback if you like it or not :)
