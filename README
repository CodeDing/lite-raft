lite-raft is still alpha-stage. the raft module is
omplete but some rewrite can occure when I come up
with more elegant code.

here the steps you need to do manually for now:
- configure conf/cluster_nodes with a space
separated list of hostname (those that will form
the cluster)

- verify that the user you use to test it is able
to execute ssh on between node without password
and without confirmation for ssh key fingerprint.

- copy the lite-raft directory on every node and 
execute it with ./lite-raft first-boot

to stop it on a node: ./lite-raft stop
to start (from second time and on): ./lite-raft start
to insert a test entry ./lite-raft-client set key value
to make a conditional set: ./lite-raft-client if key = X set Y
to make a get: ./lite-raft-client get key
to add a node to the cluster: ./lite-raft-client add-member node2
to delete a node to the cluster: ./lite-raft-client del-member node2
(cluster configuration change are performed online!)

once you have a running raft cluster you can run package-controller

copy the pkg-scripts/template on pkg-scripts/package1, customize it
and then configure some parameters on the state-machine:
./lite-raft-client set packages/prova/enabled true
./lite-raft-client set packages/prova/owner ""
./lite-raft-client set packages/prova/tick 0
./lite-raft-client set packages/prova/timeout 30

on each node that can run the package execute:
./package-controller package1

and watch what happen if you stop one of them :)

(package-controller is still in early stage of development, is more
a proof of concept that a finished work.)

read the code and give me feedback if you like it or not :)
