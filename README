lite-raft is still under early development stage.
this release is just to for preview and playing.

here the steps you need to do manually for now:
- configure conf/cluster_nodes with a space
separated list of hostname (those that will form
the cluster)

- verify that the user you use to test it is able
to execute ssh on between node without password
and without confirmation for ssh key fingerprint.


- copy the lite-raft directory on every node and 
execute it with ./lite-raft first-boot

to stop it on a node: ./lite-raft stop
to start (from second time and on): ./lite-raft start
to insert a test entry ./lite-raft dummy

read the code and give me feedback if you like it or not :)

enjoy!

ps: many features are not implemented yet, I'm working on
it. come back to check in few days if something changed!

todo:
when a conf_old_new command is received the configuration
is changed, but if the log is deleted by a future leader
while it's not committed the configuration change is not
automatically rollbacked up. the client that ask for the
configuration change must assure that all is done correctly,
eventually repushing the old configuration.
